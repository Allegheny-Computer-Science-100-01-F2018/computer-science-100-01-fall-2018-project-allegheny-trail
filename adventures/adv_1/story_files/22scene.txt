[Scene_Text]<The path slopes up gradually towards the small castle on the hill. You notice that the path, while wide
enough for a carriage and some guards, tapers off at the edges and slowly turns into a cliff face. You take in
your surroundings as you continue the slow climb. The castle is more of a glorified mansion with ramparts and 
a single tower up front and to your right. The tower has a fungus-like dome on top. As you finally reach the
gate before the castle, before you lies a variety of maces, makeshift spears, finely crafted swords, blunt
knives, and wooden shields. There are also the remnants of Fresian Horses, which are those criss-crossed wooden
stakes that are meant to deter cavalry, but I am sure you already knew that. The portcullis is raised and 
the large wooden doors are wide open. It seems like some sort of battle took place, but you can't be sure.>
