[Scene_Text]<The path slopes up gradually towards the small castle on the hill. You notice that the path, while wide enough for a carriage and some guards, tapers off at the edges and slowly turns into a cliff face. You take in your surroundings as you continue the slow climb. As you finally reach the gate before the castle, you stop at the gate to observe the mess of scattered weapons before you.>
[Key]<OBSERVE>
[Obj](CASTLE)<The castle is more of a glorified mansion with ramparts. There is a single tower at the front right corner of the stone structure. The tower looms high above the rest of the building and has a fungus-like dome on top...>{goto[22]}
[Obj](WEAPONS)<You take a closer look at the numerous weapons lying in the dirt. Before you lies a variety of maces, makeshift spears, finely crafted swords, blunt knives, and wooden shields. On the ground near each weapon is a small troop of mushrooms. Every weapon has a clean blade. There are also the remnants of Fresian Horses, which are those criss-crossed wooden stakes that are meant to deter cavalry and are seen frequently in medieval films where a siege takes place, but I am sure you already knew that.>{goto[22]}
[Obj](GATE)<Upon closer inspection, the gate appears to be rotted. Mushrooms are sprouting from the sections of rot. The portcullis is raised and the large wooden doors are wide open. It seems strange to you that a gate would be wide open for what you thought was the scene of a battle.>{goto[22]}
[Key]<GO>
[Obj](CASTLE)<Having seen enough at the gate, you try to calm your nerves as you approach the castle. You feel strangely guilty... The castle grounds are as empty as you believed they would be. Upon walking through the front door, you are met with a heaviness in the air. You feel enveloped in darkness, and the smell of fungus and mold lingers in your nose.>{goto[23]}
