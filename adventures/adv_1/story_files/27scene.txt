[Scene_Text]<You pull the sheets over your body and shut your eyes. The covers are the softest you
believe you have ever felt. It feels as if you have come home to your bed after a long day's travel.
Sleep slowly takes a hold of you and the world becomes dark.>

[Obj]()<You hear the sound of a bell. One that is rung only when under siege. You rush out of
the room in a fury. Yells can be heard outside. A clattering of weapons. The sound of horses and
the gate opening in the distance. A door opens to your left and you see purple robes. You are blinded
by the midday sun. Yelling in the distance, closer than before. Servants running about the castle. A
woman's cry of fear. A small child wailing for its father. The door on your left slamming shut and
a deadbolt locking in place. More running. More yelling. A scream from above. An explosion. An Earthquake.
\nSilence.>{goto[00]}
