For our project, we have decided to create our own Text Adventure. Our minimum for this
adventure would be a simple stroll through the woods, accompanied by a sarcastic
narrator and silly situations. We are being very ambitious with this project and are
thinking of increasing our work load to create an entertaining adventure. We plan on
including multiple choices, failures,repeated situations, and a save system for when the
player inevitably make the wrong mistake. The whole process, however, once initially
written, will become easier with each added event. The exact events to take place are
still in the air, but will surely be accompanied by the judgmental tone of a sarcastic
narrator. Time permitting, we will also include some puzzles, but seeing how ambitious
we already are on the project, and how high the workload may already be, we may not be
able to include this. Should we be able to do all of this, we might even make a second
adventure for the player to choose from.

The Text Adventure itself will be very modular and to quote Danny, we will "basically be
making an engine to run everything." Our motivation behind this is simply based around
the idea that creating one would be fun, and our completed adventure would hopefully be
even more fun to play. With what planning we have done so far, we find ourselves more
involved in wanting to both create it and play it ourselves. We plan on splitting the
work between us, with some of our attention being split between the main file and the
story/events that occur.

We have four team members and can divide the excess work amongst ourselves.
