Our motivation for this project was to create a modular text based adventure game, both from personal interest, and because we saw it as an opportunity to harness our collective skills. Throughout the whole process, we slowly began to divide our effort based on our personal skills. For each of us, this project can serve as a starting point for any future endeavors. If one of us were to decide to make another, serious, text adventure, we would simply use this code and change the scene files, while could be added or reduced based on the needs of the story. Since we have spent so much time working on this project, it proves to be a testament of our skill and dedication to the project, which is in itself a source of entertainment for whoever uses it. Users could also use this to create their own adventures, since the program is modular, not hardcoded. There is a small chance that we will continue to work on this text adventure in one way or another in the future, either for our own personal enjoyment, or in a future assignment, should it be allowed. We are all very proud of our finished product.
This project was a team effort as each member of our four person team had an important role. Danny and Caden worked together to write the majority of the code, with Danny taking a leading role in the coding and Caden working on optimization and adding missing features. Zach wrote the entire story with Maxâ€™s help. Zach also provided Caden and Danny with the functionality he needed to write the story the way he wanted. Max spent most of his time working on the UML diagrams and helping extensively with planning how the code will work in the initial stages. The code was a big challenge but the creation of the UML diagrams was equally difficult due to the complexity of the code. The story was also a challenge in its own right because everything needed to intertwine and connect properly.
