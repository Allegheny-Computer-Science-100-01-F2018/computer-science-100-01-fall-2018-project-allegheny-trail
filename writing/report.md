# Project Report
# Group members: Danny Ullrich, Maxwell Boshaw, Caden Koscinski, Zachary Canali

Danny's Contribution:
This project was a team effort as each member of our four person team had an important role. Danny and Caden worked together to write the majority of the code, with Danny taking a leading role in the coding and Caden working on optimization and adding missing features. Zach wrote the entire story with Maxâ€™s help. Zach also provided Caden and Danny with the functionality he needed to write the story the way he wanted. Max spent most of his time working on the UML diagrams and helping extensively with planning how the code will work in the initial stages. The code was a big challenge but the creation of the UML diagrams was equally difficult due to the complexity of the code. The story was also a challenge in its own right because everything needed to intertwine and connect properly.
