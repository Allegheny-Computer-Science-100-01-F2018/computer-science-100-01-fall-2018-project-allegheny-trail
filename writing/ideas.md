# Five Ideas
# Group members: Danny Ullrich, Max Boshaw, Caden Koscinski

1. Command line based choose your own adventure game
Texted based adventure that supports infinite scalability through modular text file based story arcs.
The game will have multiple randomized paths with multiple actions per event.

2. ATM/Bank program
A more realistic and in depth atm/bank program starting with the ATM lab as a base. The resulting program would be more feature rich with user interface and primitive GUI.

3. Escape Room Puzzle
Text based room escape puzzle with a more open ended approach. The game would be a linear path to escape.

4. Battle-Ship
Classic game of battleship with an AI opponent. Game would include a scoring system and a high score table.

5. Watch Virtual Paint Dry
Run a loop that slowly changes the color of the many lines of text that represent the painted wall. Include an if statement for whether the paint is dry yet. User can input a question to ask when the paint will be dry and the response is always "soon".
